# OmniForge AI

**A Universal, Secure, and Extensible Multi-Agent Platform for End-to-End Autonomous Design, Validation, and Execution Across All Human Disciplines.**





 🧠 Overview

**OmniForge AI** is a next-generation autonomous multi-agent framework designed to convert natural language prompts into auditable, executable, and policy-compliant outcomes across science, engineering, healthcare, policy, architecture, and beyond.

Rather than acting as a passive chatbot, OmniForge actively decomposes high-level objectives, validates each task, and orchestrates specialized AI agents to execute complex, interdisciplinary workflows in real-time.



🚀 Core Capabilities

- 🧩 **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** LangGraph-based planner-dispatcher pipeline for intelligent task delegation.
- 🧠 **Foundation Models:** Utilizes LLaMA-3 and Mixtral models served via NVIDIA Triton with sub-3s latency.
- 🔐 **Secure Memory Stack:** Combines Weaviate (vector), Neo4j (symbolic), and Redis (short-term) with encryption.
- 🛡️ **Safety & Trust Layer:** Includes GuardrailsAI, OPA, human-in-the-loop review, and Amazon QLDB audit trail.
- 🔍 **Observability Layer:** Powered by Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo, ensuring 7-year WORM-compliant telemetry.
- 🛠️ **Skill Plug-In Ecosystem:** Modular, containerized Skill Packs with type-safe prompts and unit-tested endpoints.
- 🌐 **Toolchain Integration:** Automated API workflows using n8n and circuit-breaking Envoy proxies.
